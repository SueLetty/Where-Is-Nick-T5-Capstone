# Native IntelliJ project template

This template is intended as a project starter, using the native IntelliJ project structure and build system, but providing a slightly more complete starting point than that generated by the New Project wizard dialog in IntelliJ IDEA.

For help in getting started with additional project configuration, see [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md).

We recommend that the developer(s) replace the heading and body of this file with the name and summary of their project.

Introduction: You are now currently enrolled as a student of TLG Learning facility. You will be greeted by Jeanette in the lobby to get you into the building. You will have to go through different levels of coding class in order to graduate from the program. Get ready to learn and soak up your mind to become a real software engineer!
